supports asyncio and the required libraries. Anyway, it's recommended to use the latest version of both Python and pip.
- Install Python from the `official site <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ (or use your package manager)
- Install pip following the `instructions <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/#installation>`_
