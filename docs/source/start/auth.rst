Creating your API token
=======================

To use the Riot Games' API first you need to create a token. In order to do this:
    - Go to `this page <https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal>`_ and follow the steps to register a product
    - Start registering for a personal API key, since you probably don't have a working prototype needed for a production key
    - The approvation step could take days (or weeks) to finish, so i suggest you go `here <https://developer.riotgames.com/>`_ and use a development API key until you get a permanent key
    - Development API key need to be refreshed every 24h, so remember to refresh yours or your application will sotp working
